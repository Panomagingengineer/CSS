<h1>Statement Of the Problem </h1> <hr>
<p>he invasive janitor fish in the Marikina River alters ecosystems through burrowing, causing bank erosion, sediment suspension, and habitat degradation. However, quantitative data on how hydrodynamic factors affect burrow distribution and characteristics are limited. Understanding these patterns is essential for managing erosion, conserving biodiversity, and mitigating the fish’s ecological impact.
